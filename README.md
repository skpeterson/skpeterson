- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there friend, Iâ€™m Sara Peterson!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her

I am on a journey to become a computational cancer genomics expert through my PhD in Bioinformatics at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill! I am working in the laboratories of Ian Davis and Alex Rubinsteyn (https://github.com/pirl-unc) using bioinformatics software to study fusion driven cancers.

- Prior to starting the PhD program in fall 2023 I worked as an engineer at GE, developing new 3D printing ceramic materials for jet engine applications for 5 years!
- I had never used R or Python prior to starting my computational PhD! It's never too late to try something new!!!
 
âš¡ Fun facts
- I am an avid traveler and adventure seeker! I have been to 31 countries and been sky diving twice!! One time, it was from 18,000 ft which is the maximium height for commercial folks to drop from!
- I love dogs and have two very wonderful, sweet squishes, Molly and Benson! They make sure I leave the computer screen and get outside a few times everyday!!
